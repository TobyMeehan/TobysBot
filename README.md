# Toby's Bot

My discord bot, doesn't do anything in particular, but since a bunch of music bots got _taken care of_ it now mainly serves as a replacement for those.

## Invite
You can invite Toby's Bot to your server at [bot.tobymeehan.com/invite](https://bot.tobymeehan.com/invite). Alternatively I publish docker images for every release, so you can host your own if you would prefer.

## Commands

A full list of commands is available at [bot.tobymeehan.com/commands](https://bot.tobymeehan.com/commands), you can also use `\help` for an overview. `\` is my prefix of choice, but I am working on enabling a custom prefix and slash commands.

Originally this was a demo using discord.js to try out the discord API. Once music was added I changed to my native language of C#. As a wrapper for discord I used [Discord.NET](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net), and [Victoria](https://github.com/Yucked/Victoria) for music.
